# Renderer
#
# • Performance: Set WGPU rendering performance
#   - High: Adapter that has the highest performance. This is often a discrete GPU.
#   - Low: Adapter that uses the least possible power. This is often an integrated GPU.
#
# • Backend: Set WGPU rendering backend
#   - Automatic: Leave Sugarloaf/WGPU to decide
#   - GL: Supported on Linux/Android, and Windows and macOS/iOS via ANGLE
#   - Vulkan: Supported on Windows, Linux/Android
#   - DX12: Supported on Windows 10
#   - Metal: Supported on macOS/iOS
#
# • disable-unfocused-render: This property disable renderer processes while Rio is unfocused.
#
# • level: Configure renderer level
#   - Available options: 0 and 1.
#       Higher the level more rendering features and computations
#       will be done like enable font ligatures or emoji support.
#       For more information please check the docs.
#
# Example:
# [renderer]
# performance = "high"
# backend = "automatic"
# disable-unfocused-render = false
# level = 1

# Keyboard
#
# use-kitty-keyboard-protocol - Enable Kitty Keyboard protocol
#
# disable-ctlseqs-alt - Disable ctlseqs with ALT keys
#   - For example: Terminal.app does not deal with ctlseqs with ALT keys
#
# Example:
# [keyboard]
# use-kitty-keyboard-protocol = false
# disable-ctlseqs-alt = false

# Fonts
#
# Configure fonts used by the terminal
#
# Note: You can set different font families but Rio terminal
# will always look for regular font bounds whene
#
# You can also set family on root to overwrite all fonts

# Scroll
#
# You can change how many lines are scrolled each time by setting this option.
#
# Scroll calculation for canonical mode will be based on `lines = (accumulated scroll * multiplier / divider)`,
# If you want a quicker scroll, keep increasing the multiplier.
# If you want to reduce scroll speed you will need to increase the divider.
# You can use both properties also to find the best scroll for you.
#
# Multiplier default is 3.0.
# Divider default is 1.0.
# Example:
# [scroll]
# multiplier = 3.0
# divider = 1.0

# Navigation
#
# "mode" - Define navigation mode
#   • NativeTab (MacOS only)
#   • Bookmark
#   • BottomTab
#   • TopTab

# "clickable" - Enable click on tabs to switch.
# "use-current-path" - Use same path whenever a new tab is created (Note: requires `use-fork` to be set to false).
# "color-automation" - Set a specific color for the tab whenever a specific program is running, or in a specific directory.
#
# Example:
# [navigation]
# mode = "bookmark"
# clickable = false
# hide-if-single = true
# use-current-path = false
# color-automation = []

# Shell
#
# You can set `shell.program` to the path of your favorite shell, e.g. `/bin/fish`.
# Entries in `shell.args` are passed unmodified as arguments to the shell.

#   - (Windows) powershell
[shell]
program = "nu"

# Bindings
#
# Create custom Key bindings for Rio terminal
# More information in: https://raphamorim.io/rio/docs/key-bindings#custom-key-bindings
#
# Example:
# [bindings]
# keys = [
#   { key = "q", with = "super", action = "Quit" },
#   # Bytes[27, 91, 53, 126] is equivalent to "\x1b[5~"
#   { key = "home", with = "super | shift", bytes = [27, 91, 53, 126] }
# ]

# Log level
#
# This property enables log level filter and file. The default level is "OFF" and the logs are not logged to a file as default.
#
# Example:
